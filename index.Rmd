- For personal or private administrative issues, the email contact is: ETC5512.Clayton-x@monash.edu
- Lectures are recorded, and you are expected to have either attended the lecture, or watched the recordings fully, prior to the computer lab for the week.
- Computer labs are not recorded, and attendance is expected.
- Bring your own laptop to the computer labs. If you **do not** have a laptop you can borrow one from [MoVE](https://www.monash.edu/learning-teaching/innovation/educational-technologies/move)
- **If you register after the start of the semester** or if you
  miss a lecture/lab, it is your responsibility to catch up with
  missed material, learn about due dates for material to be turned in,
  and getting assigned to a group for team work, as necessary.
- The computer software R and RStudio will be used fr the unit.
- Lab quizzes are due each week, prior to the computer lab. Quizzes will be available at flux.qa/REAB3Q. You need to sign in with your Monash student account. If you do not enter your name and Monash student authcate correctly, it will result in n marks for the quiz. Each quiz has five equally-weighted multiple-choice questions. A quiz is due at the start of the computer lab each week.

- Computer labs: **Thu 2-3pm**, LTB 92. Bring your own computer, with necessary software already installed.
