* This involves identifying:
  * the **population of interest** (e.g. if studying about male baldness pattern, your population of interest is the biologically male population),
  * what **responses** (dependent variables) or **covariates** (explanatory or independent or predictor variables) to capture and how to measure it (e.g. do you collect their age? Which range of age they are in? Their hair count? The thickness of the hair?),
  * the **sample size** (how many samples do we need?),
  * any **structure** that will be in the data (e.g. population structures, repeated cross-sectional data, panel or longitudinal data), and 
  * any **restrictions** (e.g. ethical concerns, limitation on collecting data).

  * designing so your sample estimates give (theoretically) unbiased estimates of the population parameters,

# Systematic Design of Experiments

&gt; **Randomisation** applied to order of tasting (probably)

* Why don't we order the treatments in a **systematic order**?

--
* Isn't this easier to manage the experiment?

--
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class="info-box w-90"&gt;
Systematic designs are prone to &lt;b class="monash-blue"&gt;bias&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b class="monash-blue"&gt;confounding&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Randomisation

.w-70[
* Treatments should be allocated *randomly* to experimental units. 
* This avoids:
  * .monash-blue[**systematic bias**] - e.g. all flu vaccine A tested in January (summer) and all flu vaccine B tested in July (winter).
  * .monash-blue[**selection bias**] - e.g. giving the treatment that you are testing to the sick patients and placebo to those that are healthy.
  * .monash-blue[**other bias**] - e.g. the lab technician giving the treatment to the first rat that is taken out of the cage.

# Blocking

.info-box.w-50[
 .monash-blue[**Blocks**] are used to group the experimental units into alike units.
]
--
.w-70[
* If well done, blocking can lower the variance of treatment contrasts which increase power.
* A non-homogeneous block (i.e. units within block are *not* alike) can decrease the power of the experiment.

{{content}}

]

--

You can form blocks from:


* **Natural discrete divisions** between experimental units. &lt;br&gt;E.g. in experiments with people, the gender make an obvious block.
* Grouping experimental units with similar **continuous gradients**. &lt;br&gt;E.g., if the experiment is spread out in time or space and there exists no obvious natural boundaries, then an arbitrary boundary may be chosen to group experimental units that are contiguous in time or space.

# Taxonomy of types of data studies

- **Experimental data**: the gold standard of data collection, but very difficult
- **Observational data**:
    - **census**: all (or close to all) members of the population are measured
    - **survey sample**: each member of the population has a known probability of being selected into the sample, eg cohort study, cross-sectional, case-control, cluster/hierarchical, multi-stage
    - **non-random sample**: it is not known how the sample relates to the population
    - **censored**: events might happen outside of observation interval, eg observed up to 30,000km but brake failure was at 45,000 km
    - **occurrences**: only when an incident is observed is it recorded, eg wildlife sightings, warranty claims, complaints
        

.info-box.w-100[
 Knowing how the sample of data relates to the population is an essential ingredient for making .monash-blue2[inferential statements] and making decisions with data.

Atlas of Living Australia at https://www.ala.org.au. The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is a collaborative, digital, open infrastructure that pulls together Australian biodiversity data from multiple sources, making it accessible and reusable.

The ALA helps to create a more detailed picture of Australia’s biodiversity for scientists, policy makers, environmental planners and land managers, industry and the general public, and enables them to work more efficiently.
