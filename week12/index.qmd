## Time has come to wrap up this unit

Suppose you are the data curator. What should you know?

::: {.callout-note style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;"}
## Learning Objectives

We will learn:

-   About organising data into spreadsheets for analysis
-   Rules for caring and feeding your data
-   Realistic guide to making data available
:::

. . .

We will also discuss SETUs and Assignment 4 today.

# Wild Caught Data {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Back in week 1 ...

<br><br>

::: callout-tip
## Open data is ... [^1]

-   a raw material for the digital age but,

-   it's unlike coal, timber or diamonds,

-   it can be used by anyone and everyone at the same time.
:::

[^1]: https://www.europeandataportal.eu/elearning/en/module1/#/id/co-01

. . .

Let's remind ourselves some examples why open data is important!

## Why do we need open data?

::: callout-important
**Help make governments more transparent.**

-   Open data allowed citizens in Canada to save the government billions
    in fraudulent charitable donations

**Building new business opportunities**

-   Transport for London has released open data that developers have
    used to build over 800 transport apps.

**Protecting the planet**

-   Open data can supoort early warning systems for environmental
    disasters
-   Open data is also helping consumers to understand their personal
    impacts on the environment

::: {.callout-note style="background-color: white; width: 50%; float: right; clear: right;"}

## Our working definition

**Wild caught data** is:

::: incremental
-   data the can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any
    purpose, and

-   The data source is traceable, the data collection is transparent,
    and the data is updated as new measurements arrive, and

-   In case of data processing, the process is clearly described and
    reproducible.

- It should be fresh, interesting, exciting!

- And ideally collected locally, and about our own lives

:::
::::

## Tell me about cool examples!

<br>
It's important to stop and reflect on what we've learnt.

::: callout-note
## Break out session

Discuss in your tables open data examples you've seen that:

-   promote transparency and accountability\
-   create new business opportunities, or\
-   generate benefits for society.

You may also like to reflect on our case studies or where you can source open data from.

:::

. . . 

How has your understanding of open data changed since you started this
unit?

# Common pitfalls {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Working with wild data

:::callout-caution 

* Wild caught data is inherently messy 
* That's partly because the real world is messy! So the data reflects that 

:::

. . . 

But their are some common pitfalls we can easily avoid!

## Example: Johns Hopkins COVID19

## Difficulties

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Changing formats!

## Spreadsheets for computer consumption

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- write dates like YYYY-MM-DD,
- do not leave any cells empty, 
- put just one thing in a cell, 
- organize the data as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row), 
- create a data dictionary, 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- do not include calculations in the raw data files, 
- do not use font color or highlighting as data, 
- choose good names for things, 
- make backups, 
- use data validation to avoid data entry errors, and 
- save the data in plain text files.

## Watch out for dates

Good practice to store dates as Year, Month, Day columns. Much is safer across systems.

## Remmber tidy format

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::callout-tip

The cells in your spreadsheet should each contain one piece of data. Do not put more than one thing in a cell.

:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
 * In assignment 1 we saw a column with "HAZARD flooding". It would be better to separate this into "HAZARD" and "flooding" columns.

* Remember, airlines data, time zone in one column, departure time in another. This is partly technical because multiple time zones can't be stored in a single column. 

:::

::::

## Create a data dictionary

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

The census has an extensive data dictionary for each year distributed, giving variable names, and also explanation of levels in categorical variables.  

But, it can still be hard to find what you are looking for.

## 10 Simple Rules

<br>
Goodman et al (2014) created [ten Simple Rules](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003542) for the Care and Feeding of Scientific Data. These apply to us. 

. . . 

<br>
We can replace "science" with "data science", "data analysis", "analytics", "business intelligence". 

. . .

<br>
🤔 So think about what these rules imply for business and government data.

## All too common

<center>
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/data_pipeline_2x.png" width="100%"> 
</center>

## Care and feeding

:::callout-tip 
## The Rules 

1. Love Your Data, and Help Others Love It, Too

2. Share Your Data Online, with a Permanent Identifier

3. Conduct Science with a Particular Level of Reuse in Mind

4. Publish Workflow as Context

5. Link Your Data to Your Publications as Often as Possible

6. Publish Your Code (Even the Small Bits)

7. State How You Want to Get Credit

8. Foster and Use Data Repositories

9. Reward Colleagues Who Share Their Data Properly

10. Be a Booster for Data Science

:::

## Rule 1

Love Your Data, and Help Others Love It, Too

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::callout-note

**What are some ways to show your love?**

**What data have we seen that isn't loved?**
:::

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
- Nurture: 
    - feed, 
    - hug, check on it
    - dress it nicely
    - give it a name
    
- Show it off: 
    - tell someone about it
    - demonstrate how it can be used
:::

::::

## Rule 2

Share Your Data Online, with a Permanent Identifier

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::callout-note 

- Give it a name: digital object identifier (DOI)
- Adequate documentation and metadata
- Employing good curation practices

:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Common resources:  
- [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/)  
- [FigShare](http://figshare.com/)  
- [Dataverse](http://thedata.org/)  
- [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/)  
:::

::::


## Rule 3

Conduct Science with a Particular Level of Reuse in Mind

::: callout-note

- keep careful track of versions of data and code
- to be fully reproducible, then *provenance* information is a must 
    - working pipeline analysis code, 
    - a platform to run it on, and
    - verifiable versions of the data. 
- what types of re-use do you think others might make of your work?

:::

## Rule 9 

Reward Colleagues Who Share Their Data Properly

::: callout-note 

- Build promotion and award systems that count data and code-sharing activities.
- Consider this activity an important part of your own data science work. 
- Clear guidelines for credit

:::

## BTS air traffic

[Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DataIndex.asp) (Assignment 1)

- Many, many different tables. The extent and value of the ontime performance database may not be immediately obvious. Need to know what you are looking for, many links, and several clicks deep ❌ 
- Sporadically missing chunks ❌  
- No API for other software, laborious to download large chunks ❌
- Data provided by airlines is required, regular reporting is incentivised. Regularly updated, time stamp ✅ 
- Small chunk `csv` file is nicely rectangular ✅ 

## Atlas of Living Australia

[CSIRO](https://www.ala.org.au/) (Assignment 1)

- Vast amount of data ✅ 
- Many different ways to access, including API ✅ 
- Hard to navigate the ways to access and what information is provided ❌ 
- Data stored is sporadic, on a volunteer basis ❌ 
- Data identifier (DOI) is provided with each download ✅ 

## ABS Census Data

- Updated regularly, for each census ✅ 
- Data packs, easy to find ✅ 
- Download has regular file structure ✅
- Finding variable of interest is hard, though ❌ 
- Spreadsheet with a gazillion tables, and variables are coded into column headers ❌

# Making your own cake! {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Assignment 4 - Brief 

::: callout-tip
## Some me what you can do!

-   Show off what you've learnt and how far you've come!   
 *Everyone will
    be on a slightly different journey here.*

-   You can either use open data to analyse a question you:

    -   find fun or are passionate about, or

-   Use open data to consider a question that:

    -   promotes transparency and accountability\
    -   create new business opportunities, or\
    -   generate benefits for society.
:::

## Assignment 4 - Skills

::: callout-tip
## What I'm examining

In **Task 1** I want to see you can:

-   source open data appropriate for a task

-   can clearly document the download and processing steps

-   can curate your data to share with others

:::

## Assignment 4 - Skills

::: callout-tip
## What I'm examining

In **Task 2** I want you share your own case study in a blog:

-   show you know how to be curious about data

-   show you can use open data to answer a question

-   show you can think critically about a problem

-   show you can write about your analytics

-   show off the coding skills you've learnt 
:::

## Assignment 4 - Reflection

::: callout-tip
## What I'm examining

In **Task 3** I also want **you** reflect on your analysis:

-   share challenges you faced working with your data

-   share specific insights into your approach

-   share your ambitions for future work

-   share limitations of your data or analysis (may also apply for
    task 2)

-   clearly communicate any assumptions (may also apply for task 2)
:::

## Skill demonstration

:::callout-note 
## Success 

To be successful on assignment 4 I suggest going back through the lectures so far. 

Take a look at the variety and depth of topics we've covered! 

Ensure that in assignment 4 you demonstrate knowledge gained from a few of the different lectures and assignments.

## Parting Comment

:::: callout-important
## I love teaching this unit

I truly believe the skills you encounter in this unit, particularly the learning to deal with messy real-world data and the problem solving skills will set you in good stead for whatever career you have after this.

I also like to think that you will take with you a healthy respect for data ethics and data privacy, and I am grateful I got to share that with you.

I wish everyone the best of luck in their future studies and careers.
