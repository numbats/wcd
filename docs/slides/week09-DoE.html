# &lt;i class="fas fa-vial"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Experiments

* **Experiment** is a procedure that is carried out to test a hypothesis or understand a phenomenon.
* One of the most common experiment is a **comparative experiment** which compares different sets of conditions referred to as .monash-blue[**treatments**].
* These treatments are applied to .monash-blue[**experimental units**] - the smallest division of the experimental material such that any two units may receive different treatments in the actual experiment. 
* The smallest unit which the response is measured on is referred to as the .monash-blue[**observational unit**].
* Note that observational unit is *not* the observation nor the response!

# Wheat Yield Trial: ANOVA .circle-it[1B]

.grid[
.item.border-right[

* Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is historically used in the analysis of experimental data to test if any treatment is significantly different from others:

`$$H_0: \texttt{gen}_1 = ... = \texttt{gen}_{107} = 0.$$`

* Although ANOVA is still used today, it is widely recognized as a special case of linear models.
* ANOVA table shows the decomposition of the total variation by source - we won't go into depth about ANOVA in this course.

* The varieties `VF655`, `TINCURRIN` and `WW1477`  have a .monash-blue[**replication**] of 6, the remaining 104 varieties each have a replication of 3. 
* Treatment **replications are essential** in an experiment; without any replication, no treatment variation can be measured nor distinguished from unit variation.
* More replications are desirable for accuracy, however, there is always a tension to balance the cost of the experiment.

* The treatments appear to be randomly ordered before.

&lt;br&gt;

* Why don't we order the treatments in a **systematic order** like on the left?

&lt;br&gt;


* Isn't this easier to manage the experiment?

* Systematic designs are prone to &lt;span class="monash-blue"&gt;**bias**&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="monash-blue"&gt;**confounding**&lt;/span&gt;. 

---

# Randomisation

* Treatment must be allocated *randomly* to experimental units. 
* This avoids:
  * systematic bias - e.g. all flu vaccine A tested in January (summer) and all flu vaccine B tested in July (winter).
  * selection bias - e.g. giving the treatment that you are testing to the sick patients and placebo to those that are healthy.
  * other bias - e.g. the lab technician giving the treatment to the first rat that is taken out of the cage. 
  
--


* So how do we randomise?
* We can make a reproducible design using R.
* Be sure to use `set.seed` in the beginning of your script.

# &lt;i class="fas fa-th-large"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Blocking

.grid[
.item.border-right[
* .monash-blue[**Blocks**] are use to group the experimental units into alike units.
* If well done, blocking can lower the variance of treatment contrasts which increase power.
* Blocking reduces the residual degrees of freedom which can decrease power if the sample size is small.
* A non-homogeneous block (i.e. units within block are *not* alike) can decrease the power of the experiment.

]
.item[

You can form blocks from:


* **Natural discrete divisions** between experimental units. &lt;br&gt;E.g. in experiments with people, the gender make an obvious block.
* Grouping experimental units with similar **continuous gradients**. &lt;br&gt;E.g., if the experiment is spread out in time or space and there exists no obvious natural boundaries, then an arbitrary boundary may be chosen to group experimental units that are contiguous in time or space.

]

.item[

* In agricultural field trials, it is common to have some underlying soil fertility trend.
* So contiguous plots may be grouped to form a block. 
* The wheat yield trial actually employed 3 blocks (as colored on left) as recorded in the variable `rep`. 
* The treatment is best to be balanced across the blocks.
* If possible, block sizes should have the same size.

2. Community transmission of coronavirus is rare. Most infected cases are from overseas or close contact with confirmed case.
3. Men are at a higher risk of death from COVID-19.
4. Children have a much higher immunity against coronavirus.
5. NSW has the highest number of coronavirus infected cases out of all the Australian states and territories. 
6. Australia started to go into lock-down from Sun 22/03/2020. The shutdown measures were effective.

# Correlation vs Causation


.info-box[
Correlation does not imply causation.
]

* Age may not be a defining factor that determines the risk of death from COVID-19. 
* There is increasing observations that those with *underlying health conditions* are at a higher risk of death from COVID-19.
* Many underlying health conditions, such as hypertension, is prevalent in elderly.
* It may be the combination of COVID-19 and other health conditions that is the causal factor of death.
* You can read more about this in this Conversation article: [Coronavirus: the puzzle of why the risk of death is greater for men and for the elderly](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-the-puzzle-of-why-the-risk-of-death-is-greater-for-men-and-for-the-elderly-135176).

# What was the data collection procedure?

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said there was no point in testing Australians simply because they had respiratory or cold and flu symptoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Other than a "small and controlled" cluster of community transmission in Sydney, cases were largely confined to returned travelers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"If you're a returned traveler or you've been in contact with someone who has been a confirmed case, then you should be tested. But other Australians do not need testing and all they're doing is putting an unnecessary burden on the testing," he said.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

# Statisticians urge random testing


* Nicholas Fisher (former chief scientist in statistics in CSIRO) and Dennis Teewin (Australian Statistician) urge random testing in Australia [&lt;i class="fas fa-newspaper"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;](https://www.afr.com/policy/health-and-education/why-random-testing-is-the-road-back-to-normal-20200413-p54j9e)
* Without an experimental study, it is hard to estimate the true level of community transmissions.
* In the beginning, the criteria for testing was for those who returned from overseas and those that were in close contact with a confirmed case. 
* It is not surprising then that the number of cases almost all belonged to those two categories in the beginning.

# Control


.info-box[
A .monash-blue[**control**] is an experimental unit that did not receive any treatment.
]

* In order to know the effect of treatment, e.g. vaccine, we must compare with something, e.g. the control. 
* Confusingly, in experimental descriptions, some regard control as one of "treatments"; some when referring to treatments, exclude control; and then some use both with context needed to infer whether control is included or not.
* Note: you do not always need a control! 
* If there is already effective treatment that is applied as a standard, then testing should be compared with this standard treatment (as was the case for breeding trial).

--

* Is "do-nothing" treatment wise comparison though?

---

# Placebo 

* When people are enrolled in a trial to test a potential treatment, the control group may be aware that they are not receiving the treatment; likewise the treatment group are aware they are receiving treatment. 
* This may result in unconscious or conscious **bias** where the control group expects they will not get better and the treatment group expects that they will get better; thus the difference in the result may not be due to treatment but due to this bias.  

.info-box[
A .monash-blue[**placebo**] is a medical treatment or procedure designed to have no  therapeutic value.]

* All participants enrolled in a study then will be assigned to a treatment or placebo group but will not be told which group they belong to.

---

# Double-Blind Study

* In a randomised controlled study, the participants are **blind** to whether they are in the treatment or placebo group.
* The experimenters, however, can still bias the results if they know which group the participant belongs to. 

.info-box[
A .monash-blue[**double-blind study**] is an experimental study that neither the participants nor the experimenters know who is receiving which treatment. 
]

* This again helps to reduce any potential bias in the study.

# Confounding variable

&lt;br&gt;

.info-box[

A .monash-blue[**confounding variable**] is a variable that is associated with the variable of interest (usually the treatment) and the response. 

]


* E.g., consider the lab technician giving the diet treatment to the first rat that is taken out of the case and leaving the other rats as control.
* The first rat taken out of cage may be slower or lazier than other rats (hence easier to catch to take out of the cage). 
* In that case the genetics or character of the rat may be confounded with treatment.

# The Salk Vaccine Field Trial 

.grid[
.item.border-right[

* The first **polio epidemic** hit the United States in 1916 claiming hundreds of thousands of victims, especially children.
* National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) was ready to test the vaccine developed by Jonas Salk in the real world.
* A controlled experiment was proposed to test the effectiveness of the vaccine on grade 1, 2 and 3 children at selected school districts though the country where the risk of polio was high.

* In total two million children were involved although not all parents consented to their children to be vaccinated.

# Design for the NFIP Study


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Vaccinate all grade 2 children whose parents would consent, leaving children in grades 1 and 3 as controls.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


* Can grade 2 children whose parents did not consent be included as control?
* What are the potential issues with such a design?
* Polio is a contact disease. Would incidences of disease be higher in grade 2?

* Higher income parents would more likely consent to treatment than lower-income parents.
* Children of higher income parents are more vulnerable to polio.
* Many forms of polio are hard to diagnose and in borderline cases.
