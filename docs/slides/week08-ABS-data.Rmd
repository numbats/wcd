"About DataPacks_readme.md - "Read Me" documentation containing helpful information for users about the data and how it is structured (.md)"

# Navigating wild-caught data


* There is no `DataPacks_readme.md` but there is .monash-blue[`AboutDatapacks_readme.txt`].

We can try going through other files in the Readme.

# Navigating wild-caught data
