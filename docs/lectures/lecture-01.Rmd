* This involves identifying:
  * the **population of interest** (e.g. if studying about male baldness pattern, your population of interest is the biologically male population),
  * what **responses** (dependent variables) or **covariates** (explanatory or independent variables) to capture and how to measure it (e.g. do you collect their age? Which range of age they are in? Their hair count? The thickness of the hair?),
  * the **sample size** (how many samples do we need?),
  * any **structure** that will be in the data (e.g. population structures, repeated cross-sectional data, panel or longitudinal data), and 
  * any **restrictions** (e.g. ethical concerns, limitation on collecting data).

# Sampling strategies

.w-70[
* Sampling strategies combine knowledge about the population with statistical methods.

  * designing so your sample estimates give (theoretically) unbiased estimates of the population parameters,

# Reality of data collection ...

  * There may be unknown or hidden structures in the population.

  * You may introduce intentional data structures, e.g.
      * Cross-sectional data,
      * Repeated cross-sectional data (e.g. case-control), 
      * Panel or longitudinal data (e.g. cohort studies), and so on.

  * You may have unintended or unknown structures in the data, e.g. confounded variables.

# Randomisation

.w-70[
* Treatments should be allocated *randomly* to experimental units. 
* This avoids:
  * .monash-blue[**systematic bias**] - e.g. all flu vaccine A tested in January (summer) and all flu vaccine B tested in July (winter).
  * .monash-blue[**selection bias**] - e.g. giving the treatment that you are testing to the sick patients and placebo to those that are healthy.
  * .monash-blue[**other bias**] - e.g. the lab technician giving the treatment to the first rat that is taken out of the cage.

# Blocking

.info-box.w-50[
 .monash-blue[**Blocks**] are used to group the experimental units into alike units.
]
--
.w-70[
* If well done, blocking can lower the variance of treatment contrasts which increase power.
* A non-homogeneous block (i.e. units within block are *not* alike) can decrease the power of the experiment.

{{content}}

]

--

You can form blocks from:


* **Natural discrete divisions** between experimental units. <br>E.g. in experiments with people, the gender make an obvious block.
* Grouping experimental units with similar **continuous gradients**. <br>E.g., if the experiment is spread out in time or space and there exists no obvious natural boundaries, then an arbitrary boundary may be chosen to group experimental units that are contiguous in time or space.
