# What makes data open?
<!-- Open data is measured by what it can be used for, not by how it is made available. -->

* Limitations
    * No limitations that prevent particular uses.
    * Anyone free to use, modify, combine and share, even commercially.
* Cost
    * Free to use does not mean that it must be free to access.
    * Cost to creating, maintaining and publishing usable data.
    * Live data and big data can incur ongoing costs.
* Reuse
    * Free to use, reuse and redistribute it - even commercially.

---
# Definition open data
Open data can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose
<br><br>
There are two dimensions of data openness:
* The data must be legally open, which means they must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions.
* The data must be technically open, which means they must be published in electronic formats that are machine readable and non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data using common, freely available software tools. Data must also be publicly available and accessible on a public server, without password or firewall restrictions.

# Why do we need open data?


* Help make governments more transparent.
    * Open data allowed citizens in Canada to save the government billions in fraudulent charitable donations
* Building new business opportunities
    * Transport for London has released open data that developers have used to build over 800 transport apps.
* Protecting the planet
    * Open data about weather can provide an early warning system for environmental disasters
    * Open data is also helping consumers to understand their personal impacts on the environment

<!-- and go over metadata and licenses. -->




---
# Why license open data?
<br><br>
* Tells anyone that they can access, use and share data.
--

* Without a licence, users may find themselves in a legal grey area. Data may be 'publicly available', but users may not have permission to access, use and share it under general copyright or database laws.
--

* An open data licence is an explicit permission to use the data for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.
--

* Open data publishers should provide easy access to the licence for all datasets that are available to access, use and share.
--

<!-- Organizations and governments use Open Data licenses to clearly explain the conditions under which their data may be used.  -->


---
# Open data licenses
<!-- Many licenses include both a summary version, intended to convey the most important concepts to all users, and a detailed version that provides the complete legal foundation. Examples include: -->

* Standard re-usable license: consistent and broadly recognized terms of use
  * Creative Commons, particularly CC-By and CC0 https://creativecommons.org/
  * Open Database License https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/
* Bespoke licenses: governments and international organizations developed 
  * UK Open Government License http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/
  * The World Bank Terms of Use https://data.worldbank.org/summary-terms-of-use

<!-- Standard licenses can offer several advantages over bespoke licenses, including greater recognition among users, increased interoperability, and greater ease of compliance. -->

# Machine Readable

.footnote[[A Primer on Machine Readability](https://www.data.gov/developers/blog/primer-machine-readability-online-documents-and-data)]

<center>
.info-box['machine readable' is not synonymous with 'digitally accessible']
</center>

* Historical efforts have focused on 
    - pushing static information about government programs and services to the web, 
    - where the intended use is a human who can read, print, and take actions based on reading.
    - It's a narrow vision of the expected users and uses of the information.
* Machine readable formats expand field of vision to new users and new uses and require technologies like XML and JSON
    - 😿 PDF is not suitably machine readable 
    - 😀 CSV (or XLSX, XLS) is common, and universally accessible, but should be structured for analysis not for reading 
    - 😸 XML, JSON is verbose, can contain metadata, but needs special readers 
    - 🤩 API provides an interface that other software can utilise to automatically extract and process

# FAIR principles for scientific data

.footnote[Learn more at https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/]

.flex[
.border-box[
## Findable
Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services.
]
.border-box[
## Accessible
Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.
]
.border-box[
## Interoperable
The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.
]
.border-box[
## Reusable
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

# Publishing data

Research data is increasingly seen as part of the corpus of scholarly publications.  Publishers, funders and governments  support researchers to publish their data outputs by various policies, guidelines and mandates.

- Obtaining a Digital Object Identifier system (DOI) provides a persistent identifier, and can be used for data. Two services in Australia:
    - [Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)](https://ardc.edu.au/services/identifier/) can generate a DOI for you.
    - [Australian National Data Service](https://www.ands.org.au/online-services/doi-service)
- Many open data sets provide information on how to cite them, when used in other forms of publication.

<br><br>
See more guidelines at [ARDS](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/publishing) and [ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/services/research-data-australia/).
