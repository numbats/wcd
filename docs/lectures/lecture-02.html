# What makes data open?
&lt;!-- Open data is measured by what it can be used for, not by how it is made available. --&gt;

* Limitations
    * No limitations that prevent particular uses.
    * Anyone free to use, modify, combine and share, even commercially.
* Cost
    * Free to use does not mean that it must be free to access.
    * Cost to creating, maintaining and publishing usable data.
    * Live data and big data can incur ongoing costs.
* Reuse
    * Free to use, reuse and redistribute it - even commercially.

---
# Definition open data
Open data can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are two dimensions of data openness:
* The data must be legally open, which means they must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions.
* The data must be technically open, which means they must be published in electronic formats that are machine readable and non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data using common, freely available software tools. Data must also be publicly available and accessible on a public server, without password or firewall restrictions. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

# Why do we need open data?


* Help make governments more transparent.
    * Open data allowed citizens in Canada to save the government billions in fraudulent charitable donations
* Building new business opportunities
    * Transport for London has released open data that developers have used to build over 800 transport apps.
* Protecting the planet
    * Open data about weather can provide an early warning system for environmental disasters
    * Open data is also helping consumers to understand their personal impacts on the environment

&lt;!-- and go over metadata and licenses. --&gt;




---
# Why license open data?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Tells anyone that they can access, use and share data.
--

* Without a licence, users may find themselves in a legal grey area. Data may be 'publicly available', but users may not have permission to access, use and share it under general copyright or database laws.
--

* An open data licence is an explicit permission to use the data for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.
--

* Open data publishers should provide easy access to the licence for all datasets that are available to access, use and share.
--

&lt;!-- Organizations and governments use Open Data licenses to clearly explain the conditions under which their data may be used.  --&gt;


---
# Open data licenses
&lt;!-- Many licenses include both a summary version, intended to convey the most important concepts to all users, and a detailed version that provides the complete legal foundation. Examples include: --&gt;

* Standard re-usable license: consistent and broadly recognized terms of use
  * Creative Commons, particularly CC-By and CC0 https://creativecommons.org/
  * Open Database License https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/
* Bespoke licenses: governments and international organizations developed 
  * UK Open Government License http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/
  * The World Bank Terms of Use https://data.worldbank.org/summary-terms-of-use

&lt;!-- Standard licenses can offer several advantages over bespoke licenses, including greater recognition among users, increased interoperability, and greater ease of compliance. --&gt;

# Machine Readable

.footnote[[A Primer on Machine Readability](https://www.data.gov/developers/blog/primer-machine-readability-online-documents-and-data)]

&lt;center&gt;
.info-box['machine readable' is not synonymous with 'digitally accessible']
&lt;/center&gt;

* Historical efforts have focused on 
    - pushing static information about government programs and services to the web, 
    - where the intended use is a human who can read, print, and take actions based on reading.
    - It's a narrow vision of the expected users and uses of the information.
* Machine readable formats expand field of vision to new users and new uses and require technologies like XML and JSON
    - 😿 PDF is not suitably machine readable 
    - 😀 CSV (or XLSX, XLS) is common, and universally accessible, but should be structured for analysis not for reading 
    - 😸 XML, JSON is verbose, can contain metadata, but needs special readers 
    - 🤩 API provides an interface that other software can utilise to automatically extract and process

# Five star open data scheme

* ⭐ - .monash-blue2[An open license]: make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license 
* ⭐⭐ - .monash-blue2[Re-usable format]: make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel proprietary instead of image scan of a table
* ⭐⭐⭐ - .monash-blue2[Open format]: make it available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel) 
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - .monash-blue2[use (Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)] to denote things, so that others can link to it, and also give context to the values
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - .monash-blue2[Link data] to definitions and context for various aspects

# FAIR principles for scientific data

.footnote[Learn more at https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/]

.flex[
.border-box[
## Findable
Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services.
]
.border-box[
## Accessible
Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.
]
.border-box[
## Interoperable
The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.
]
.border-box[
## Reusable
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.
]

# Publishing data

.footnote[See more at [The Australian National Data Service](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/publishing)]

Research data is increasingly seen as part of the corpus of scholarly publications.  Publishers, funders and governments  support researchers to publish their data outputs by various policies, guidelines and mandates.

- Obtaining a Digital Object Identifier system (DOI) provides a persistent identifier, and can be used for data.
- Many open data sets provide information on how to cite them, when used in other forms of publication.
