It may be generated via experiments, collected from observational studies or surveys, obtained via sampling, or recorded using sensors.\nEach type of data has its own characteristics that affect the analysis tools we use. Very large data sets come with their own challenges and require some database skills.\nThis unit will equip you with the tools to understand and use different sources of data. Open data sources will be emphasised."

    "text": "You are commissioned as an independent business analyst to consult with the Victorian Department of Transport and Planning.\nThe Victorian Department of Transport and Planning is considering following the lead of New South Wales Transport and Main Roads, and making data on past road incidents available for public download. But, they are yet to be convinced of the benefits of open data.\nYour job will be to download, document and process data needed to create case study examples that can be used in a showcase.\nIn this hypothetical scenario, you are preparing this data for use by another team member who has experience working with road data types. Be sure to organise the data so that is useful for that team member, and so your documentation can be included as part of a larger report."

That is a job for your team member. Also note, there is no single one answer to how to define worst road.\n\n(5 marks) You have been assigned one of the problem roads flagged in the survey (see Moodle). Using the NSW Goverment Portal create a data set for that extended region (50 km radius) that records past traffic incidents.\n\n\nInclude only the relevant incident types in your data set.\nRestrict your data to an appropriate sample period. Only 3 months of data can be downloaded at one time.\nCombine data from before and after the survey so incident numbers can be compared.\nSave your data as a .csv file.\n\n\n(5 marks) Document the download process.\n\n\nDescribe the steps you took to download your data, so your process is fully reproducible.\nDescribe how you processed your data, this should include which variables you selected and and if you filtered any rows.\nBe sure to explain how you defined the worst road.\n\n\n(5 marks) Provide a data set description.\n\n\nThis must include an explanation of the relevant variables (meta data)\nExplain if your data sample is representative of the population.
