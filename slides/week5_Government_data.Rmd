# The magnificent Great Barrier Reef

* The Australian Great Barrier Reef is one the world natural wonders and contributes $6.4 billion to Australia’s national economy 
as well as some 64,000 jobs.

# Facts about the GBR
<br>
The Great Barrier Reef makes up about 10 per cent of the world's coral reef ecosystems:
- it covers 344,400 km2 in area and it is the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem
- it includes some 3000 coral reefs, 600 continental islands, 300 coral cays and about 150 inshore mangrove islands
- it extends south from the northern tip of Queensland in north-eastern Australia to just north of Bundaberg
- it is between 60 and 250 kilometres in width and it 
has an average depth of 35 metres in its inshore waters, while on outer reefs, continental slopes extend down to depths of more than 2000 metres

# Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority
<br>
- The authority has been managing the GBR since 1975
- It is in charge of the Marine Park policy and decision making
- Also about the planning and regulation that protects key values and enable ecologically 
sustainable use for a changing Reef.

### Threats
.info-box[
 - The greatest threat to the Reef is climate change. 
 - The other main threats are associated with coastal development,
 land-based run-off, and threats from direct human use of the Reef (such as illegal fishing).

# Why monitoring the GBR?
Understanding how the resilience of the Reef is affected by pressures is vital for management.
Monitoring the inshore health of the Reef has been routinely carried out since 2005 under this 
program. Annual monitoring enables us to analyse:
<br>
<br>
.info-box[
-Trends in water quality parameters (turbidity/water clarity, nutrients) relative to the  Water
Quality Guidelines for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
- The ecological risk of mixtures of pesticides to Reef ecosystems
- Wet-season river-derived pollutant exposure
- Coral cover, seagrass abundance and ecosystem health

# Focus: Monitoring programs run by AIMS
## MMP (Inshore reefs)
<br>
.tip[
- MMP : Inshore reefs (those that can be reached from shore by a small boat) are vulnerable to 
more threats than those further from shore. 32 inshore reefs are monitored under the Great Barrier 
Reef Marine Park Authority’s Marine Monitoring Program.

- The Inshore Marine Monitoring Program (MMP) is designed to detect changes in reef 
communities adjacent to the Wet Tropics, Burdekin, Mackay, Whitsunday and Fitzroy Natural 
Resource Management Regions.

---
# Focus: Monitoring programs run by AIMS
## LTMP (Mid and outer shelf)
.tip[

- LTMP: For over 30 years, AIMS has been surveying the health of 47 midshore and offshore reefs across 
the Great Barrier Reef region. The Long-term Monitoring Program represents the longest continuous record 
of change in reef communities. 

- Data caputures natural variability of coral and fish populations, and documents effects of disturbances 
such as crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, cyclones and bleaching events.
Also it provides awareness of other threats to the Reef (such as outbreaks of coral disease) 
and other issues of concern to reef managers.

- Sites are at least 250 m apart where possible. Within each site, five 50 m transects
are laid along the reef slope parallel to the reef crest at about 6-9 m depth. 
- Transects are marked with a star picket at each end and with lengths of reinforcing rod at 10 m intervals.

# Monitoring
<br>

- The AIMS Long-term Monitoring Program (.blue[LTMP]) is designed to detect changes in reef communities at a subregional scale. In this context, a subregion encompasses inshore, mid-shelf and outer shelf reefs across the continental shelf within one band of latitude (a sector).

- The Inshore Marine Monitoring Program (.blue[MMP]) is designed to detect changes in reef communities adjacent to the Wet Tropics, Burdekin, Mackay, Whitsunday and Fitzroy Natural Resource Management Regions.

# Visualizing monitoring locations using map widget
## Steps
<br>

 - Using the function make_bbox() from the ggmap package, we are
 going to create a bounding box for the longitude and latitude 
 collection in our data set.
 - Then using the leaflet() function, we will start creating the
 layers of our map. We will add a tile layer from a known map provider such as 
 googlemaps for example.
 - After that we will decide on the symbols that we want to use in our map to mark 
 our sampling locations

Then our leaflet map will be ready! Demo

# Maps using shape files
## Shape files
<br>
.blue[Shapefiles] are a common way to store geospatial data. 
<br>
.info-box[
A shapefile is a simple, nontopological format for storing the geometric location and
attribute information of geographic features. Geographic features in a shapefile can be
represented by points, lines, or polygons (areas). The workspace containing shapefiles 
may also contain dBASE tables, which can store additional attributes that can be joined to a shapefile's features.
]

[More info](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/shapefiles/what-is-a-shapefile.htm) 


---
# More on shape files
<br>
.info-box[
The term "shapefile" is quite common, but the format consists of a collection of files with a common filename prefix, stored in the same directory.
The three mandatory files have filename extensions .shp, .shx, and .dbf. The actual shapefile relates specifically to the .shp file, but alone is incomplete for distribution as the other supporting files are required. Legacy GIS software may expect that the filename prefix be limited to eight characters to conform to the DOS 8.3 filename convention, though modern software applications accept files with longer name

# Registering for Google maps API 
<br>
In order to be able to use all the capabilities from the *ggmaps* R package 
you would  need to create a Google maps API.

<br><br>
- For that you can use your monash email account (you will not have to pay)


---
# Get API

- Visit the Google Cloud Platform Console.
- Click the project drop-down and select or create the project for which you want to add an API key.
- Click the menu button  and select APIs & Services > Credentials.
- On the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key.
- The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.
- Click Close.
- The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys.

[Google Cloud Platform console](https://cloud.google.com/free)

# Get API for free using a free  trial
<br>
.blue[Your API key is private and unique to you, so be careful not to share it online, for example in a GitHub issue or saving it in a shared R script file.]

<br><br>
-  To create a free API you can go to  https://cloud.google.com/free and use your Monash log in details
- Follow the instructions
- Then create a new projet
- More instructions here [Instructions page here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key)
