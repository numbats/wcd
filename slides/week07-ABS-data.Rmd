# What is wild-caught data?

--

* data can be freely used 
--

* data can be modified 
--

* data can be shared by anyone for any purpose
--

* data source is traceable
--

* data collection is transparent 
--

* data are updated as new measurements arrive
--

* if any data processing, the process is clearly described and reproducible

# Observational data

**Population** is the whole set of units (such as people, animal, place etc) to which the question or experiment pertains to.


**Sample** is a subset of population that (hopefully) represents the population.

# Sample or population?

<br>

.info-box[
Vò is a small town in northern Italy with .blue[3,300] inhabitants. All inhabitants of the town were tested and retested for COVID-19. On 6th March, there were .blue[89] infected in Vò. There are .blue[4,636] known cases of infection out of about .blue[60 million] people in Italy on 6th March. As of 31st March, there are no longer new cases of infection in Vò and .blue[101,739] known cases in all of Italy.

* Depends on the question of interest!

* We have the population data for Vò but for the whole of Italy, the number of known infection cases would be a sample.

# Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 

* ABS is the independent statistical agency of the Government of Australia. 
* If you are from outside Australia, find the statistical government agency in your country <i class="fas fa-wrench gray"></i>, e.g. in Japan, this is the [Statistics Bureau of Japan](https://www.stat.go.jp/english/).
* ABS provides key statistics on a wide range of economic, population, environmental and social issues, to assist and encourage informed decision making, research and discussion within governments and the community.

# Table G17

There are few things to note:

* There are 201 columns in G17A and G17B and 81 columns in G17C. 
* Perhaps there is an export limitation for a data that contains more than 200 columns, thus it is broken up into different csv files.
* Which means that you have to join the tables G17A, G17B and G17C as one (you'll do this in the tutorial <i class="fas fa-wrench gray"></i>).

# What is Tidy Data?

<br>

.info-box[

## Tidy Data Principles

1. Each variable must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
]

So what about the ABS 2016 Census Data?

* The table header in fact contains information!
* E.g. .monash-blue2[`F_400_499_15_19_yrs`] is female aged 15-19 years old who earn $400-499 per week (in Victoria).
* The number in the cells are the **counts**.
* Is the data tidy?

# Tidying the ABS 2016 Census Data

* Ideally we want the data to look like:

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(tibble::tibble(age_min = 15, age_max = 19, gender = "female", 
                             income_min = 400, income_max = 499, count = 4020),
              rownames = FALSE, 
              options = list(lengthChange = FALSE, dom = "t"))
```

* You can include other information, e.g. geography code (useful if combining with other geographical area) or average age/income.

* Note that some don't have upper bounds, e.g. .monash-blue[`M_3000_more_85ov`]. In R, `-Inf` and `Inf` are used to represent $-\infty$ and $\infty$, respectively.

* You'll wrangle the data into the tidy form in tutorial  <i class="fas fa-wrench gray"></i>

---

# Raw Data vs. Aggregated Data

* Although the data collected was from individual households surveying each person in the household (see sample form [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2901.0Main%20Features802016/$FILE/2016%20Census%20Sample%20Household%20Form.pdf)), the downloaded data are .monash-blue[aggregated].
* Aggregated data presents summary statistics from the *raw data*. When the only summary statistics are counts then it is generally called *frequency data*.
* The raw data collected would be similar to the form

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(tibble::tibble(household_id = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2),
                             person = c("John Smith", "Jane Smith", "David Smith", "Mary Smith", "John Citizen", "Jane Citizen"),
                             gender = c("F", "M", "M", "F", "M", "F"),
                             age = c(40, 39, 10, 8, 32, 33),
                             maritial_status = c("Married", "Married", "Never married", "Never married", "Never married", "Never married"),
                             income_per_week = c("400-499", "300-399", "Nil", "Nil", "400-499", "1750-1999")),
              rownames = FALSE,
              options = list(lengthChange = FALSE, dom = "t"))
```

---

# What you lose in aggregate data

* For aggregate data, there are less scope for you to draw insights conditioned on other variables. 
* E.g. based on frequency data alone, you cannot answer questions like: how many middle income families with 2 children?
* Raw data are desirable if you can get hold of it!
--


## Trust and skepticism


* By the way, did you notice anything odd about the dummy data presented in the last slide?
--



* John Smith was recorded as female and Jane Smith as male. Data may have been incorrectly recorded. 
--



* How much do you trust the aggregate data?
* Have some healthy dose of skepticism in your data.


---

# Data Confidentiality

* The data is not just aggregated, but it is also .monash-blue[anonymised]
* E.g. in .monash-blue[`2016_GCP_Sequential_Template.xlsx`], Sheet "G 17a", footnote says "*Please note that there are **small random adjustments** made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data. These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from table totals.*"

--


* Why is confidentiality of data important?
