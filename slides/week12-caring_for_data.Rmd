An article in Lancet, one of the oldest and best known journals that publishes general medical articles, "found Covid-19 patients who received the malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients". Within days, the World Health Organization had halted its support for trials of hydroxychloroquine. Australian infectious disease researchers began questioning the published results very quickly. 

---

- An important point to note is *The data relied upon by researchers to draw their conclusions in the Lancet is not readily available in Australian clinical databases, leading many to ask where it came from*. 
- This is not the norm for research articles today, where most journals require the data and software to be made available so that others can verify the results. 
- The numbers for the Australian cases did not match the data that researchers here knew. So they made some phone calls.

The first to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, who confirmed that they were not the source of the data.  Next to health departments in NSW and Victoria, who also confirmed that they did not provide the data. And then to the hospitals themselves, which provoked this response 

*Dr Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor with Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the Australian hospitals involved in the study should be named. He said he had never heard of Surgisphere, and no one from his hospital, The Alfred, had provided Surgisphere with data. "Usually to submit to a database like Surgisphere you need ethics approval, and someone from the hospital will be involved in that process to get it to a database," he said. He said the dataset should be made public, or at least open to an independent statistical reviewer. If they got this wrong, what else could be wrong?" Cheng said.*

Replace "science" with "data science", "data analysis", "analytics", "business intelligence". 

- keep careful track of versions of data and code
- to be fully reproducible, then *provenance* information is a must 
    - working pipeline analysis code, 
    - a platform to run it on, and
    - verifiable versions of the data. 
- what types of re-use do you think others might make of your work?
