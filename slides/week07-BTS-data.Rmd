# Traffic patterns over time

<img src="images/airlines_volume.jpg"  style="width: 1200px"/>

Number of flights in millions per year: steadily increasing volume until 2001, with a big drop in 2002. Volume recovered in 2003, and flattens 2004-7, with another drop in 2008. What happened in 2001? What was happening in 2008?
